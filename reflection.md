**Responsive Web-Page Development Reflection:**

In creating my responsive webpage, I chose to use the more opinionated Tailwind CSS framework due to my previous experience working with it on smaller React personal projects. This decision made me unable to add an external CSS file as asked for in the assignment description, as Tailwind CSS encourages styling directly within the class names of HTML elements. To keep the project scope simple, I utilized Tailwind via its CDN and CLI, avoiding the need for Node.js and numerous additional dependencies.

Making my webpage responsive proved more challenging than the initial creation of the pure HTML website. I had to completely redesign the structure of my HTML, replacing the original table-based layout with nested divs to better align with modern CSS practices. Despite the extra effort, Iâ€™m very pleased with the updated design and layout. Incorporating CSS not only modernized the webpage but also made it visually appealing and worth showcasing to my friends and family! I was able to maintain my space theme, while also making it more interesting, such as overlaying text over a video of the earth, creating an interactive gallery, adding hover effects, and incorperating more futuristic, modern, and consistent color schemes.

As with the earlier pure HTML assignment, the most difficult aspect of this project was the creative process. Designing interesting and "cool" webpages from scratch can be challenging without a clear template or idea to guide the work. In this assignment, I did use some very basic JavaScript in order to get my Hamburger nav bar working and to get the countdown to work on my homepage, as I didn't see the assignment description saying we can't! I though this addition helped in my responsivness and overall style of my page. 

Overall, I had fun transforming my pure HTML webpage into a presentable and responsive webpage and I'm excited to work on it further in the future!
